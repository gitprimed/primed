# Git, primed

- [Starts you up faster](https://github.com/gitprimed/primed/milestone/1)
- [Helps you keep going](https://github.com/gitprimed/primed/milestone/2)

# What?

The primary idea (goal 1) is:

1. You run `primed [my-new-project]`
2. If project name supplied, you get some questions, and then a repo is set up and pushed to github
3. Or if you barely run `primed` you get a new project with everything autogenerated. Think `rails new` + `heroku create-and-deploy`
4. Your literal next step can be to start writing business code.
5. ... and profit?

[Goal 1: Have few or no up-front choices and start building directly](https://github.com/gitprimed/primed/milestone/1)

# Why keep using primed?

This is very much [up for debate](https://github.com/gitprimed/primed/issues/7).

Basically, running `prime` inside an already primed repo should help you keep up to date with things. Like, imagine some/several from: tools, automated code mods, code style, fixing deprecations, any devops-related things.

[Goal 2: Using `primed` in a primed repo can help you keep up with your upstreams](https://github.com/gitprimed/primed/milestone/2)

# Help wanted!

What tools already do something similar? [Answers here, please](https://github.com/gitprimed/primed/issues/new)

# Boot strapping

If primed already existed, it would be used to boot strap this repo.

Best approximation might be to add several parent repos and do a squid-merge. Bonus points for mixing in git-filter and post merge scripts.

This could allow template repos to stay simple and clean, enabling users to mix and match at will.

And thats the wrap? This might just be the PoC we're looking for. [Comments?](https://github.com/gitprimed/primed/issues/new)
