# Boot strapping

If primed already existed, it would be used to boot strap this repo.

Best approximation might be to add several parent repos and do a squid-merge. Bonus points for mixing in git-filter and post merge scripts.

This could allow template repos to stay simple and clean, enabling users to mix and match at will.

And thats the wrap? This might just be the PoC we're looking for. [Comments?](https://github.com/gitprimed/primed/issues/new)
